However, due to the design of WordPress itself, the only ways to achieve direct access to certain parts of the <code>head</code> section of your pages are via calls from your theme files or via output buffer hacks. The simple theme updates are explained fully in the instructions and take no more than a couple of minutes to complete. However, if you would rather not add new template tags to your theme files, you can choose instead to enable the lower performance <em>Sledgehammer Mode</em>, in which case this plugin will use the same type of brute force output buffer hacks that other SEO plugins use to circumvent the design limitations of WordPress."
